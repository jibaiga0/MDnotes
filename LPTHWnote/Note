1. install and setup python
	to make it easy, I just install a Linux system in whitch python is always there!!

2. Things about editor and bash commands I already know. And I USE VIM!!!!

3. learn how to '''print'''. And looks like '''# ''' is to comment out things(IMPORTANT TO COMMENT THINGS!!!).

4. make utf-8 work add this : '''# -*- coding: utf-8 -*- ''' at the top of the file.

5. OK, now learn some MATH!!!
	math symbols:	+ - / * % < > <= >= 

6. Assignment  of variables and do the calculation.
	To do '''if....else''' it should be like : 
	'if XXXXXXX :
		do this
	else :
		do that'
