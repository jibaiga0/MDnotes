## Getting started with Programming
- type a string `"NAME"` and to know it's "length" using `"name".length`.
- basic math with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. 
- write some comments with `//`
- An "interactive" example : `confirm("Confirmation dialogue!");` (It pops up a confirmation box.)
- "Alert" user with `alert()`.(An alert box will pop up.)<<--better add this in.
- Ask user to input something : `prompt("What are you asking for?");`.(A box asking for input will pop up.).
- basic data types: "numbers", "strings", and "boolean".
- print out things in console by : `console.log()`
- print out data in web page document by :`document.write()` <<-- learned it from elsewhere.
- comparison operators: `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `===`, `!==`. (Careful, single `=` is for assignment of value, `==` or `===` is for comparison equal.)

## Basic logics
- `if` statement.

```
if(this){
    console.log("that");
} else {
    console.log("another thing");
}

```

If this then print that in console. Otherwise print another thing in console.
- other than `console.log()` we can use `prompt()` or `alert()` or `confirm()` to make it interactive.
- Some more math an the precedence.( All works like in the school.)
- The "modulo" symbol: `%` will return the **remainder** of X devided by Y: `X % Y`.
