# Beginning JavaScript Chapter 5 - An Object-Based Language
## We Will Learn
- Using JavaScript's built-in object to work with complex data
- Creating custom objects.
- Defining custom reference types.

## What are objects? 
- A **car** *object* has a **color** *property* whitch has a **red** *value*. You can use it's *method*/*function* such as **ignition**, **beep the horn**,**changing gear**...etc. And sometimes you need to give a *parameter* to use it's *function* like 1, 2, 3, or, 4 to change the gear. Some *functions* may *return* values to the user, like the cold air from air conditionor.
- Before this point, we are dealing with *primitive* data. Actual data whitch is not complex.
- When do we need to use *object*? Take time calculation for example. If we do it in traditional math calculation, it's going to be complicated to handle the 24 hours a day, 60 minutes an hour values. So the `Date` object comes in handy!
