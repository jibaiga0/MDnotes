### Week 5 Dictionary

1. List vs Dictionary
	list: linear collection of values that stay in order
	dictionary: collection of values who have their own labels.NO ORDERS IN DICTIONARY!!!!   (Key/Value)
	make empty list by `list()`
	make empty dictionary by `dict()`
2. it is powerful!!!

3. syntaxe
```
purse = dict()
purse["money"] = 12
purse["candy"] = 5
print purse
```
this will print out:
```
{"money":12, "candy":3}
```
